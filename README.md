# DevelopedInCanada
A simple view to fly your (not at all freak) flag.

Features:

* Says your app was developed in Canada!
* Optionally, you could say it was *proudly* developed in Canada, but you'll have to edit the code.
* Shows a maple leaf beside that.
* Automatically adapts to dark mode. Credit goes to Canada for picking a nice red.
* That's it, if we're being honest.
