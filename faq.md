**What is this and why does it exist?**

Because I'm a Canadian and I wanted to put a maple leaf in my app. I woke up mad at the state of the world, as many of us likely do. There's not much I can do about the world, but I can put a maple leaf in my app.

In fact, I can go an hour further and put a reusable maple leaf view on Github.

**What restrictions are there on its use?**

From me, absolutely none. This code is public domain or CC0, depending on what gives you the most reusability. I claim not ownership and accept no responsibility.

I can't even tell you not to use it if you're not Canadian, but ***come on***. Behave.

* I don't guarantee it won't explode your computer, though it certainly seems unlikely.
* I don't guarantee that your business partners/employers won't go apeshit on you. You should probably ask them.
* I don't guarantee Apple won't reject the app, though if they reject mine I'll report back here.
* I don't guarantee you won't get sued, review bombed or detained for a strip search at a border crossing.
* I don't guarantee anything else, for that matter.

Use at your own risk.

**Do you want credit?**

No. That's not the point. In fact, to be really clear, **I prefer to not be credited**. The point was for me to be obstinate and proud. I want to enable you, fellow Canadian, to also be as obstinate and proud as you feel like being. Feel free to tell other developers, though!

**What about changes?**

It's public domain/CC0, and the point is to be obstinate and proud. Make all the changes you want.

If you want to change it to say *Proudly Developed in Canada*, go for it. I'm likely going to do this.

If you want to change it to say Made in Canada or Product of Canada, I personally wouldn't. I'm not telling you not to do this, but saying Made in Canada or Product of Canada seems to carry an extra burden of proof. Even if it's true. Feel free to do your own research and do whatever you want, though.

**Where'd you get the flag?**

Wikipedia, public domain, [right here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maple_Leaf.svg), downloaded, scaled and added to an .xcassets file. That's it.
